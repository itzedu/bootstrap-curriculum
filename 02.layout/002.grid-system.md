# Grid System

[placeholder for video]

The Grid System is a twelce column layout that allows developers to create responsive views up to five tiers. The system is built on top of flexbox. For more information on flexbox, checkout this guide: [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background)


## 12 Column System

The grid system has the following class hierarchy: containers, rows, and columns. Let's look at an example.

```html
<div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-1">
            First column
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-5">
            Next 5 columns
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            Next 6 columns
        </div> 
    </div>
</div>
```

Inside the container, we can have as many rows as we want, and each row will be automatically divided into 12 columns. We can choose the breakpoints of the columns by naming classes appropriately. Look at this handy table below:

These breakpoints determine when are columns laid out horizontally versus stacked vertically. In the example above, we have 3 `divs` set with columns that are medium sized. According to the breakpoints, medium sized columns are defined by being greater than `768px` in width. Therefore, when our row becomes less that `768px` wide, our divs will stack vertically instead of horizontally.

## From stacked to horizontal

By starting with `.col-sm-` classes, your colums will start stacked, and become horizontal at the small breakpoint (`540px`)

```html
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">col-sm-4</div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">col-sm-4</div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">col-sm-4</div>
</div>
```

## Multiple breakpoints

You can also use a combination of column classes to control how the content behaves depending on the screen size. Let's look at these examples below:

```html
<div class="row">
    <!-- full width on mobile but always 8 columns on medium and above -->
    <div class="col-12 col-md-8">.col-12 .col-md-8</div>
    <!-- half width on mobile but always 4 columns on medium and above -->
    <div class="col-6 col-md-4">.col-6 .col-md-4</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <!-- Columns start at 50% wide on mobile and bump up to 33.3% wide on desktop -->
    <div class="col-6 col-md-4">.col-6 .col-md-4</div>
    <div class="col-6 col-md-4">.col-6 .col-md-4</div>
    <div class="col-6 col-md-4">.col-6 .col-md-4</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <!-- Columns are always 50% wide, on mobile and desktop -->
    <div class="col-6">.col-6</div>
    <div class="col-6">.col-6</div>
</div>
```
