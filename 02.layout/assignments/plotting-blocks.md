# Plotting Blocks Assignment

In this assignment, you will practice breakpoints and the grid system. In the `plotting-blocks-start` folder, you will find the starter code. Your goal is to make the following work:

![plotting-blocks](https://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/plotting-blocks.gif)

As you can see, we want stacked columns for viewports less than small, 2 columns per row for  viewports from small to medium, and 4 columns per row for viewports larger than medium.

If you like to see how I did it, you can go directly to the `plotting-blocks-end` to see the code.
