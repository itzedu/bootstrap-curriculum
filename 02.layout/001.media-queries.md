# Media Queries

[placeholder for video]

CSS uses the `@media` rule to detect information about the device being used to access the website. For example, it can be used to detect the size of the device, its capabilities, and its orientation. For this course, we will be using it to detect the device size, but keep in mind that it is capable of much more.

These are the following breakpoints that Bootstrap uses:

```
// Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
// No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
```

## Containers

Bootstrap requires us to use a `container` class to enable these breakpoints with the grid system. There are two types of containers: `container` and `container-fluid`. The differece is that the former will adjust its width depending on the `max-width` of the breakpoint, while the latter, will take `100%` full-width spanning the intire width of the viewport.

```
<div class="container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>

<!-- or -->

<div class="container-fluid">
  ...
</div>
```
